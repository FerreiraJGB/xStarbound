# xSB-2

This is a fork of [OpenStarbound](https://github.com/OpenStarbound/OpenStarbound). Contributions are welcomed. You **must** own a copy of Starbound to use xSB-2. Base game assets are not provided for obvious reasons.

Compiled builds for Linux and Windows should be available in the usual place on this repository.

If you're compiling xSB-2 anyways, make sure it loads the game assets in `/assets/xSBassets/`.

## Building

On Linux:

1. Install Clang and LLVM:
   - **Arch/Garuda:** `sudo pacman -S clang llvm` (version 16; consider using `-Syu` first).
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install clang-16 llvm-16`.
   - **Fedora/Nobara:** `sudo dnf install clang llvm` (may be version 16 or 17, depending on OS version).
   - **SteamOS:** Install Homebrew, then `brew install llvm@16`. If you don't mind modifying your root filesystem, use the `pacman` command above instead.
2. Download the latest source tarball (or clone the repo) and extract.
3. `cd xSB-2/`
4. `scripts/linux/setup.sh 3` (increase that `3` to `4` or more if you've got a beefy system).
5. Executables should appear in `$src/dist` if built successfully.

On Windows:

1. Download and install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/whatsnew/). Make sure to install C++ support (and optionally the game dev stuff).
2. Download the latest source ZIP (or clone the repo) and extract.
3. Go into `scripts\windows\` and double-click `setup64.bat`.
4. Wait for that batch file to finish, go up two folders, open up `build\` and double-click `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj`.
5. Select **Build â†’ Build Solution** in Visual Studio.
6. Executables should appear in a new `xSB-2\dist\` folder if built successfully.

## Changes

- You can now make `.patch` files that are just merged in, early-beta-style (Kae). That's why the patch files in `assets/xSBassets` are unusually simple.
- Almost all Lua callbacks from the original xSB (by FezzedOne), `input` callbacks (by Kae), plus some extra `player` callbacks for compatibility with OpenStarbound mods and some StarExtensions mods. The `setSpecies` and `setIdentity` callbacks will not let you switch to a nonexistent species. Documentation has yet to be updated.
- Various crash fixes (Kae and FezzedOne).
- Character swapping (rewrite by Kae from StarExtensions): `/swap <name>` (case-insensitive substring matching) and `/swapuuid <uuid>` (requires a UUID; use the one in the player file name).
- Custom user input support with a keybindings menu (rewrite by Kae from StarExtensions).
- Positional voice chat that works on completely vanilla servers; is compatible with StarExtensions. This uses Opus for crisp, HD audios. Rewrite by Kae from StarExtensions.
  - Both menus are made available in the options menu rather than as a chat command.
- Multiple font support (switch fonts inline with `^font=name;`, `.ttf` assets are auto-detected). Added by Kae, fixed by FezzedOne.
- World lightmap generation has been moved off the main thread (Kae).
- Experimental changes to the storage of directives in memory to greatly reduce their impact on frametimes (Kae).
  - Works well when extremely long directives are used for "vanilla multiplayer-compatible" creations, like [generated](https://silverfeelin.github.io/Starbound-NgOutfitGenerator/) [clothing](https://github.com/FezzedOne/FezzedOne-Drawable-Generator).
- Client-side tile placement prediction (rewrite by Kae from StarExtensions).
  - You can also resize the placement area of tiles on the fly.
- Support for placing foreground tiles with a custom collision type (rewrite by Kae from StarExtensions; requires an OpenSB or xSB-2 server) and, via `world.placeMaterial()`, placing tiles not connected to existing ones (FezzedOne; requires an xSB-2 server). Tile placement with this feature is not network-compatible with servers that support the similar feature present in StarExtensions, although already-placed tiles work just fine. A [fork of WEdit](https://github.com/FezzedOne/xWEdit) with support for these features is available.
  - Additionally, objects can be placed under non-solid foreground tiles (Kae).
- Some minor polish to UI (FezzedOne and Kae).
